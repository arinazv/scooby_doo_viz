# scooby_doo_viz

For the hackaton visualization project we have decided to analyse a dataset about a famous cartoon Scooby-Doo.
We have examined different aspects of the series and tried to reveal interesting facts and correlations.

In the list below you can see the hypotheses that we came up with:
- the name of the series are mostly associated with the names of main characters and with some “mysterious” vocabulary 
- due to the fact that the series are about adventures of four teenagers and their dogs, the most common phrase is "Scooby-Doo, where are you?"
- the rating will be higher if there are more monsters in the episode 
- Shaggy and Scooby eat the most food in the series 
- the more monsters there are to catch, the more food the characters need

Likewise, we were interested in distribution between different seasons and their ratings. Moreover, we wanted to know who caught and unmasked more monsters. Also we were wondering if there is a correlation between terrain, most common phrases and their amount. 

For our project we used different kinds of charts to see what works best for different distributions, comparisons and correlations. 
Among them are wordclouds, pie charts, box and whiskers plot, violin plot, bar charts, heat map and some others. 

This project is based on the [Scooby Doo dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/readme.md).

The authors of the project: Arina Zvereva, Elizaveta Shemshurina, Aleksandra Nuzhnenko.
